## User Story
**As an** avid Marvel fan or just Marvel-curious,

**I want** to see media related to Marvel characters,

**I want** the research to be done for me automatically and 

**I want** to be presented with options and choices for character exploration,

**So that** my interest keeps growing and I can feel more connected with Marvel Universe.
